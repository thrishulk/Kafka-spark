**Confluent Kafka Advantages:**
1. Client API support for more languages along with Java which is only available for Apache Kafka.
2. Wide range of connectors available (HDFS, JDBC and Elastic Search connectors). 
3. REST Proxy - adds a REST API to Apache Kafka, so you can use it in any language or even from your browser. 
4. Schema Registry - if you use Avro, the schema registry will store the Avro schemas for each topic for you and help with schema evolution and compatibility. 
5. Support - Confluent Platform is supported by Confluent. Apache Kafka on its own is not really supported by anyone.
